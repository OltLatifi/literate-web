    <h2 class="text-lg pb-4">This is a website i made, so i can try out Sveltekit. It uses Django for the backend, sveltekit & tailwind for the frontend, and jwt for authentication. It's inspiration came from my friends who say that i make some weird questions, so i made a website to remind them of myself. You can use it to practice TOEFL speaking excercises. Leave a question you would want to be on the website.<br/>Follow me on twitter @olt_latifi or @pplot__ and on github @OltLatifi </h2>
